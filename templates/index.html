            <h2>The Magic of Snow</h2>
            <p>
                Snow is formed when water vapor in the atmosphere freezes into ice crystals. 
                These tiny crystals combine to form snowflakes, which drift down to earth in the chilly winter air.

            <h2>Winter Storms</h2>
            <p>
                Winter storms bring dramatic weather, from blizzards that cover landscapes in white to icy winds that chill to the bone.
                These storms often form when cold polar air collides with moist air from warmer regions.

            <h2>The Science of Cold</h2>
            <p>
                Cold weather occurs when the tilt of the Earth causes less sunlight to reach certain areas.
                This leads to lower temperatures and the hallmark chill of wintertime.
